# Vedat Ipek Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created during my web development course using HTML and CSS.

## How This Site Was Created

- Based on templates from [htmlandcssportfolio.com](http://htmlandcssportfolio.com/), I typed the code from scratch to understand how the site works.
- I experimented by removing and restoring lines of code in both HTML and CSS to learn their effects.
- Customized fonts, colors, and hover effects to make the site my own.
- Added personal content in Home, About, and GitHub sections.
- Included images to enhance the design and presentation.

## Projects Completed in This Course

- Developed a responsive portfolio website using HTML and CSS.
- Practiced debugging and code experimentation.
- Learned deployment via GitHub Pages.
